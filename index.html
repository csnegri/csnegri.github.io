        <h1 class="body-titles" id="me">Summary </h1>
        <p>I'm an interdisciplinary researcher and activist, researching the intersection of data protection/privacy (broadly), computer science, requirement engineering, security (broadly), and regulatory bodies. I'm a research associate at the IRiSC group at the SnT, University of Luxembourg ((https://irisc-lab.uni.lu/). I'm also the president of the Latin-American NGO OptIA, where we promote transparent and inclusive algorithms from a socio-technical perspective. 

I got my PhD at the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne in requirements engineering, titled "STAP - Socio-Technical dAta Protection framework for requirements with divergent mental models" .  I also hold a Ms.C (distinction and honors) in Interactive Digital Media from Trinity College Dublin and a professional degree (5 years diploma) in Political Science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. </p>

      <p> My main area of interest is new technologies' requirements for data protection, cybersecurity and socio-technical challenges. My research, in particular, 
        takes an interdisciplinary and user-centered point of view on requirements engineering, taking special consideration of regulation. </p> 
  
      <p>My CV is available in <a href="CV_Negri_academic_eng.pdf" target="_blank">this link </a>. </p> 

  
    <h1 class="body-titles" id="me">More about me </h1>
        <p>I'm also interested in OSINT, intelligence, and security studies; however, I have other research areas. Recently, I have started researching responsible information systems, focusing on fairness and transparency. In the past, I have TA'ed an introduction to programming (Python) and assisted in the requirement engineering,  blockchain technology, and research methodology classes at Paris 1. I'm also giving blockchain and data protection courses at other universities (both in Chile and France).  </p>
   
      <p>As part of my PhD program, I participated in the Scholars Programme from the Europaeum, a two-year intensive training program on policy and leadership. You can read more about it  <a target="_blank" href="https://europaeum.org/programmes/scholars-programme/">here</a> (or at this link https://europaeum.org/programmes/scholars-programme/). I participated in and led the Portal2EU policy proposal as part of the project. You can check more about Portal2EU<a target="_blank" href="https://portal2eu.com/"> here </a> or at this link https://portal2eu.com/.  </p>
        
      <p> I'm an active member of civil society, participating in different NGOs, particularly OptIA, of which I'm currently president. OptIA is a South American NGO focused on algorithmic accountability, transparency, and inclusion. I've collaborated with various institutional bodies of different countries on technology-related topics, presented at academic conferences, and given general public talks about technology/privacy in radio shows, webinars, non-academic conferences, and presentations to governmental bodies. I was selected (somehow) as one of 100 young leaders of Chile in 2022 (100 jóvenes líderes). You can find if I'll be participating in future events below. Sometimes, I give online courses about blockchain or others in Spanish (for the moment, due to time issues, this is not foreseen until 2024). </p> <!--   upcoming class at <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/csnegri" target="_blank">this link </a> or https://www.buymeacoffee.com/csnegri ) -->

      
     <p>I'm an amateur photographer. In my spare time I like to drink coffee, listen to jazz, doing sports (bouldering if I can) and, travel. I also really enjoy City Pop and French touch... Currently based in Europe, however I'm a nomad. </p> 
 
    <h1 class="body-titles" id="contact"> Contact info </h1> 

  
    <p> I'm always interested in collaborations or just having a cup of coffee. You can contact me at claudia[point]negri[point]ribalta[at]uni[point]lu or at csnegri[at]uc[point]cl. I also try to answer <s>Twitter (@csnegri) </s> I try to avoid Twitter now, Mastodon (@csnegri@mastodon.online) or LinkedIn. Sometimes, the emails go to the spam folder or get lost in my inbox. If I haven't answered, please SPAM me.</p>
