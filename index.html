        <h1>About me</h1>
        
        <p> I'm a  PhD candidate from University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne,researching data protection and other socio-technical
          requirements for new technologies, focused specially on the GDPR (but always reading about all the other regualtions), under the supervision of Prof.Camille 
 Salinesi and Co-supervisor Nicolas Herbaut. My research interest range from data protection, privacy (broadly), software requirements and cyber-security (broadly).  
          I'm interested in OSINT, intelligence and security studies, however it isn't my current area of research. </p> 
       
          <p>My thesis takes an interdisciplinary and user-centered point of view, taking special consideration of regulation. 
          That's to say, if there is a research methodology from sociology, 
        I will probably read about it and try to implement it for IS. Why? Because I believe the future of major complex problems lies in interdisplinarity.</p>

        <p>Apart from my academic life, I'm an active member of the civil society and participate in many iniciatives - too many sometimes. I'm one of the founding 
         members of OptIA, a South American NGO focused on algorithmic accountability, transparency, and inclusion. I've also collaborated with different authorities
        from Chile on topics about technology and have given various talks about privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, technology and others. </p>
        
        <p> As for my education, I'm a political scientist from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile and hold an Ms.C. (dist) in Interactive Digital Media 
          from Trinity College Dublin. My complete academic and profesional CV are available upon request. </p>
         
        <p> I'm an amateur photographer and barista. I love a good cup of coffee with jazz. </p> 
        
        <p> Currently living in Paris, however I'm a nomad. </p>
