# Welcome to my website! 

Hey there! This is the GitHub of my personal website! Here you can read the code, get the documents directly and others. 

There is not much more to say than that. Maybe, sometime in the future I might upload some documents here but nothing really interesting

[the information below is about the theme I'm using, which is minimal]
# Minimal Theme

This is the raw HTML and styles that are used for the *minimal* theme on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

OSINT student: good, you went beyond. Maybe some interesting information in the code? Certainly if you do some network analysis you'll find him
