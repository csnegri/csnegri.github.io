        <h1>About me</h1>
        
        <p> I'm a  PhD candidate from University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne,researching data protection and other socio-technical
          requirements for new technologies, focused specially on the GDPR (but always reading about all the other regualtions).
       I'm researching from an interdisciplinary and user-centered perspective, taking special consideration of regulation. 
          That's to say, if there is a research methodology from sociology, 
        I will probably read about it and try to implement it for IS. Why? Because I believe the future of major complex problems lies in interdisplinarity.</p>

        <p>Apart from my academic life, I'm a very active in the civil society and participate in many iniciative - too many sometimes. I'm one of the founding 
         members of OptIA, a South American NGO focused on algorithmic accountability, transparency, and inclusion. I've also collaborated with different authorities
        from Chile on topics about technology and have given various talks about privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, technology and others. </p>
        
        <p> As for my education, I'm a political scientist from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile and hold an Ms.C. (dist) in Interactive Digital Media 
          from Trinity College Dublin. </p>
         
        <p> I'm an amateur photographer and barista. I love a good cup of coffee with jazz. </p>
