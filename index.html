        <h1 class="body-titles" id="me">Summary </h1>
        <p>I'm an interdisciplinary researcher and activist, researching the intersection of data protection/privacy (broadly), 
          computer science, requirement engineering, security (broadly), and regulatory bodies. I got my PhD  
          at the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne in requirements engineering, title "STAP - Socio-Technical dAta Protection framework for requirements with divergent mental models".
          I'll soon by starting as a research associate in cybersecurity at Interdisciplinary Research Group in Socio-technical Cybersecurity (https://irisc-lab.uni.lu/) - SnT of the University of Luxembourg.
          I also hold a Ms.C (distinction and honors) in Interactive Digital Media from Trinity College Dublin and a professional degree (5 years 
          diploma) in Political Science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. </p>

      <p> My main area of interest is new technologies' requirements for data protection, cybersecurity and socio-technical challenges. My research in particular, 
        takes an interdisciplinary and user-centered point of view on requirements, taking special consideration of regulation. </p> 
  
      <p>My CV is available in <a href="CV_Negri_academic_eng.pdf" target="_blank">this link </a>. </p> 

  
    <h1 class="body-titles" id="me">More about me </h1>
        <p>I'm also interested in 
        OSINT, intelligence and security studies, however it isn't my current area of research. Recently I have started researching about 
        responsible information systems.  In the past I have TA'ed an introduction to 
        programming (Python),and  assisted in the requirement engineering,  blockchain technology and research methodology classes at Paris 1. I'm also giving blockchain 
        and data protection classes in other universities (both in Chile and France).  </p>
   
      <p> As part of my PhD program, I'm still participating in the Scholars Programme from the Europaeumm, which is two-years intensive trainning programme 
    on policy and leadership. </p>
        
      <p>I'm an active member of civil society, participating in different NGOs, particularly OptIA. OptIA is a South American 
        NGO focused on algorithmic accountability, transparency, and inclusion. I've collaborated with various institutional bodies of 
        different countries on topics relating to technology, presented in academic conferences, and given general public talks about 
        technology/privacy in: radio shows, webinars, non-academic conferences, presentations to governmental bodies, and others. I was selected (somehow)
         as 100 young leader of Chile in 2022 (100 jóvenes líderes)  
        You can find if I'll be participating in future events down below [on summer leave, I don't forsee many public engagement in 
        the near future]. Sometimes I give online courses about blockchain or other tech for a very low price in Spanish (you can check if there is an 
        upcoming class at <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/csnegri" target="_blank">this link </a> or https://www.buymeacoffee.com/csnegri )</p>

      
     <p>I'm an amateur photographer. In my spare time I like to drink coffee, listen to jazz, doing sports (bouldering if I can) and, travel.
 I also really enjoy City Pop and French touch... Currently based in Europe, however I'm a nomad. </p>
